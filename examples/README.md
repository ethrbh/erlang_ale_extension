# Overview

These examples demonstrate simple uses of Erlang/ALE Extension. To compile then, just
run:

    make

The examples can be run via Makefile targets.

# ex_gpio_int

For this example connect GPIO 27 to GPIO 22. GPIO 27 will be the interrupt pin,
and GPIO 22 will provides the signals to generate interrupts.
To generate interrupts just use ex_gpio_int:press_btn/0 and ex_gpio_int:release_btn/0
functions.
The default interrupt condition is rising, but it is possible change it by
ex_gpio_int:set_int_condition/1 function, where the input parameter can be:
falling | rising | both | none | enabled | summarize

Step-by-step:

	cd example
	make all
	make shell

Start test application when rising interrupt edge will generates interrupt by ex_gpio_int:start_link/0

Release the button by ex_gpio_int:release_btn/0. No interrupt event should be received by test application at this time.
	
	30> ex_gpio_int:release_btn().
	ok

Press the button again and see, rising interrupt has been received again:

Change the interrupt condition to falling edge.

# ex_mcp7940n - Configure Date&Time and Alarm in RTC device
This example introduces how to configure Date&Time in MCP7940n RTC device and it also shows how easy to configure alarm module for a specific Date&Time.
For this example GPIO-17 on Raspberry has been used as an input PIN. This PIN will receives the interrupts from RTC device. The below schematic can say much more about it.

![CONFIGURE RTC DEVICE schematic](../doc/images/schematic-ex_mcp7940n.png)

The current Date&Time (LOCALTIME) will be configured into the RTC device when start the test application and ALARM-0 module will be configured to LOCALTIME+1[min]. The GPIO-17 PIN on PI is used as interrupt PIN. This PIN is configured for able to receive interrupts from RTC device. Below printout shows the whole sequence.

Test application subscribes to "Main Power Status Change Event". With this feature application can be informed when the power of RTC lost and also will be informed when it will back to operation. For demonstrate the how it works, subscribe on "Main Power Status Change Event", than disconnect Vcc wire of RTC device.
